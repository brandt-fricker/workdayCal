## Introduction
Always running around like a chicken with your head cut off, unsure of what plan or event is next in your busy day? Fortunately the Work Day Scheduler is here to help get your head back on and add some clarity for you.  

## Description
This simple calendar application will allow a user to save events for each 
hour of the day. The hours presented represent "normal business hours", 9am to 5pm. The calendar will allow the user to input text and have the option to save what is inputted. The calendar is color coded for the user to know what hour it currently is, what hours have past, and hours still available. A key has been rendered to aid the user to understand the color code.
